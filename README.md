### **🧠 Deep Research AI Agent**

_An autonomous AI-driven research agent that **thinks like an investigator, searches like a hacker, and writes like a scholar.**_

---

## **🚀 Overview**

Deep Research AI Agent is a **self-directed research assistant** that takes a user query and autonomously:  
✅ **Breaks it down** into structured research questions  
✅ **Scours the web** using AI-enhanced web scraping (Firecrawl)  
✅ **Synthesizes findings** using a tiered AI model system  
✅ **Compiles** a comprehensive multi-page report  
✅ **Stores knowledge** in both **long-term memory** (vector embeddings) and **short-term recollection** (to dynamically compile the final report)

**Example Use Case:**  
🔍 _"Do deep research on the JFK assassination."_  
👉 The agent **formulates** key investigative questions:

- What happened?
- Who was involved?
- What were the key conspiracy theories?  
  👉 It **crawls** and extracts data, **filters noise**, and **generates** a structured research document.

## **💡 How It Works**

1️⃣ **User submits a research query**  
2️⃣ The **Research Agent** generates **key sub-questions**  
3️⃣ It **scrapes** relevant sources via **Firecrawl** and AI-guided extraction  
4️⃣ It **stores data in memory** (_short-term & long-term vectorized knowledge nodes_)  
5️⃣ The **AI synthesizes** a structured, multi-page report

## **⚡ Model Tier System**

To balance **cost vs. accuracy**, Deep Research AI uses **tiered AI models**:  
| **Tier** | **Model** | **Use Case** |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 🚀 **Top** | GPT-4o | Best for final synthesis & complex reasoning |
| 🏆 **Standard** | GPT-4o / Mixtral | Standard inference for structured responses |
| 💰 **Best Cheap** | DeepSeek / Nous-Hermes | Cost-effective for bulk analysis & summaries |
| 🏗 **Embeddings** | OpenAI Ada / DeepSeek | Vectorized long-term knowledge retention |

## **⚠️ Warning**

🔥 _This agent **will** burn through tokens like a GPU on a crypto farm._  
💸 _Running it without rate limits may cause **financial trauma**._  
🛑 **Not responsible for OpenAI API bills exceeding your rent.**

---

## **📌 Future Plans**

- **Live Agent Mode** → Continuous knowledge graph building
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** → AI researchers working together
- **Domain-Specific Tuning** → Fine-tuned for legal, financial, and medical research
